title: Software needed for Python BI training class
---

In this github page you can find some basic guidelines of how to install the software that we will use in the Python BI class. Overall we will use:

- Python
- SQL Server
- IDE of your choice (VS code recommended)

## Python

We will need Python > 3.5 version in order to build some simple CRUD applications and ETL pipelines during the course.

### Windows

Windows users please go at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and get the appropriate file for your PC. Please note that during the installation you will be asked to add Python in Path. You should enable this option.

It allows you to run your files on cmd by:

```
python python_file.py
```

If you do not enable this you will be forced to use the full python path to execute your programs. (for example, it will be something like:
c:/users/username/program files/python36/python pytthon_file.py)

### Linux

Linux and Mac users should have both 2.7.x and > 3.6.x versions installed by default on their machines. You can check your current version for both of them with:

```
python --version
python3 --version
```
